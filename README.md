<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: none;">collate-for-me</h1> 
<h3 align="center">Exclusive content consumption 👩‍💻 👨‍💻</h3>


`collate-for-me` is a platform where humans _(and bots)_  from all branches of software development can join hands to build a dashboard of your  choice, served on your computer and is not influenced by the _marketting algorithms_ of big tech corporates. 

### Application Goals
- Efficient Content Consumption of world-wide-web (www)
- Content should be based on user's choice and not manipulated for profits
- No brainer installation and workflows
- True replacement of multiple services with `Subscribe` & `Explore`


We value supportive and constructive dialogue in the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans from beginner to advanced developers, and **all are welcome** to find their place in the community.
