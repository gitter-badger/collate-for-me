## What is collate-for-me?

`collate-for-me` is a platform where humans _(and bots)_  from all branches of software development can join hands to build a dashboard of your  choice, served on your computer and is not influenced by the _marketting algorithms_ of big tech corporates. 

We value supportive and constructive dialogue in the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans from beginner to advanced developers, and all are welcome to find their place within our community. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Preview

[![git-secret terminal preview](https://asciinema.org/a/41811.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/41811?autoplay=1)

## Installation

`collate-for-me` supports `brew`, just type: `brew install git-secret`

See the [installation section](http://git-secret.io/installation) for the details.

### Requirements

`collate-for-me` relies on several external packages:

- `bash` since `3.2.57` (it is hard to tell the correct `patch` release)
- `git` since `1.8.3.1`
- `gpg` since `gnupg 1.4` to `gnupg 2.X`
- `sha256sum` since `8.21`

## Contributing

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying [code of conduct](https://dev.to/code-of-conduct). All conversations and discussions on GitHub (issues, pull requests) and across collate-for-me must be respectful and harassment-free.

### Where to contribute

When in doubt, ask a [core team member](#core-team)! You can mention us in any issues or ask on the [DEV Contributor thread](https://dev.to/devteam/devto-open-source-helpdiscussion-thread-v0-1l45). Any issue with `good first issue` tag is typically a good place to start.

**Refactoring** code, e.g. improving the code without modifying the behavior is an area that can probably be done based on intuition and may not require much communication to be merged.

**Fixing bugs** may also not require a lot of communication, but the more the better. Please surround bug fixes with ample tests. Bugs are magnets for other bugs. Write tests near bugs!

**Building features** is the area which will require the most communication and/or negotiation. Every feature is subjective and open for debate. The [product roadmap](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/projects) should be a good guide to follow. As always, when in doubt, ask!


## Contribution guideline

### Create an issue

Nobody's perfect. Something doesn't work? or could be done better? Let us know by creating an issue.

PS: a clear and detailed issue gets lots of love, all you have to do is follow the issue template!

#### Clean code with tests

Some existing code may be poorly written or untested, so we must have more scrutiny going forward. We test with [rspec](http://rspec.info/), let us know if you have any questions about this!

#### Create a pull request

* Try to keep the pull requests small; a pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
* Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit. [More info here](https://docs.dev.to/testing/)
* Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did; the code should explain what it does.
* If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like `References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305`, where 305 is the issue number. [More info here](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
* If you follow the pull request template, you can't go wrong.

_Please note: all commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged, but when your PR is approved and passes our CI, it will be live on production!_

### How to get help

Whether you are stuck with feature implementation, first-time setup, or you just want to tell us something could be done better, check out our [OSS thread](https://dev.to/devteam/devto-open-source-helpdiscussion-thread-v0-1l45) or create an issue. You can also mention any [core team member](#core-team) in an issue and we'll respond as soon as possible.

### The bottom line

We are all humans trying to work together to improve the community. Always be kind and appreciate the need for tradeoffs. ‚ù§Ô∏è
