`collate-for-me` is a platform where humans _(and bots)_  from all branches of software development can join hands to build a dashboard of your  choice, served on your computer and is not influenced by the _marketting algorithms_ of big tech corporates. 

We value supportive and constructive dialogue in the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans from beginner to advanced developers, and **all are welcome** to find their place in the community.
